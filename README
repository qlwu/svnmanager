SVNManager
----------

SVNManager is an administration suite to manage Subversion repositories on a web server.

As stated on their website:

"The goal of the Subversion project is to build a version control system that is a compelling 
replacement for CVS in the open source community."

Subversion has matured and our organisation has found more purposes to create Subversion
repositories than just for source code. Therefore it seemed nice to me to create a 
web based Subversion administration suite, with which you can:

- Create, remove, load & dump repositories
- Manage user accounts for access to the repositories
- Manage groups for access to the repositories
- Invite users by email to create an account on the server


I hope it can be useful for you and your organization.
